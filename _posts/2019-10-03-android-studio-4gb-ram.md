Android Studio is a very powerful tool when it comes to Android application development. What is it not, however is the lightest programme in the world. I personally think it could use some optimizations. It is close to impossible to use Android Studio in a machine with 4GB of memory. Yeah, it says so in their [download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).  But if you have ever tried running it with that much memory, you will feel the struggle.
