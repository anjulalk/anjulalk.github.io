      <description>Joplin desktop application supports keyboard shortcuts to a certain degree. However, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option for users to configure keyboard shortcuts according to their preferences. My project was to implement a keyboard shortcut editor along with the necessary integration.
The project consisted of two parts:
 Back-end service for handling all keymapping-related functionality Keyboard shortcut editor with the necessary functionality to alter the keymap  Progress The project was implemented in two pull requests.</description>

      <description>Even though it says in Android Studio download page that the minimum required memory is 4GB, you will feel the struggle when you run it in a machine with less than 8GB of memory.
Fortunately, there are a few tweaks you can use to make it somewhat bearable. Some of these might be not much effective, but trust me; you need every bit of performance you can get.
Switch to a lightweight Linux distribution Using a lightweight Linux distribution will make it much easier than running Android Studio with that memory hog called Windows.</description>
